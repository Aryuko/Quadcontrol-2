# Quadcontrol 2.0
**A second attempt at making software pilot a Quadcopter.**

*Authors: Peter Kj√©llen and Jesper Larsson*

## Background
We, togheter with Viktor Landemoo, constructed a quadcopter and attempted to build software to pilot it as an exam project in high school. The hardware turned out great (thanks to V. Landemoo) and while the software looked promising, in the end the low level programming, the inter-communication between modules and the physics of quadcopters simultaneously proved to challenging at the time.

Now we have a much more intimate understanding of how to utilise and design for microprocessor and inter-communication between components. With this knowledge we will make a second attempt at the software piloting the quadcopter.

## Objective and Requirments
While we have better understanding about the software side of things, we know pretty much the same as the last time about the physics. Therefore, the main objective of this project will be to build software that can interact with all circuitery on on our quadcopter and try to pilot it. The focus will be on the software challenges (e.g. communications between connected circuits, utilising the hardware and implemeting control algorithms) and not understanding the physics required for the quadcopter to fly.
